# Description

Oversecured report:
![](Oversecured_report.png)

Oversecured found in the `com/android/server/display/WifiDisplayController.java` file the unprotected dynamic receiver registration. Samsung added its additional action `android.net.wifi.p2p.REQUEST_STATE_CHANGE` which is missing in AOSP. As you can see in the vulnerability screenshot, Oversecured didn't highlight the use of other actions such as:
- `android.net.wifi.p2p.STATE_CHANGED`
- `android.net.wifi.p2p.PEERS_CHANGED`
- `android.net.wifi.p2p.CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE`
- `android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED`

Because they are declared as `protected-broadcast`. Unprivileged apps can't send broadcasts with these actions, but they can receive them. The `android.net.wifi.p2p.REQUEST_STATE_CHANGE` action was not added to this list, so an attacker could send such a broadcast and disable Wi-Fi display.

**Proof of Concept**

```java
Intent i = new Intent("android.net.wifi.p2p.REQUEST_STATE_CHANGE");
i.putExtra("requestState", false);
sendBroadcast(i);
```
